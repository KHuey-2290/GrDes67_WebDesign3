                <img src="assets/goat_coffee.png" alt="White goat carrying a twig of coffee beans." class="w-100 my-3"/>

                <p>Legend has it that Kaldi, a lonely goat herder in ninth-century Ethiopia, discovered the energising and invigorating effects of coffee when he saw his goats getting excited after eating some berries from a tree. Kaldi told the abbot of the local monastery about this and the abbot came up with the idea of drying and boiling the berries to make a beverage.</p>

                <img src="assets/saint_mocha.jpg" alt="Omar, the sheik, foraging coffee beans." class="w-100 my-3"/>

                <p>An alternative story says coffee was first discovered by a sheik named Omar, while in exile from Mocha (Arabia Felix in present-day Yemen). Somewhat hungry, Omar one day chewed some berries only to find them bitter. He tried boiling them, resulting in a fragrant brown liquid which gave him unnatural and exceptional energy and allowed him to stay awake for days on end.</p>

                <img src="assets/coffee_mug.jpg" alt="Big coffee mug with a saying, 'BLACK AS NIGHT SWEET AS SIN.'" class="w-100 my-3"/>

                <p>Coffee, like alcohol, has a long history of prohibition, attracting fear and suspicion and religious disquiet and hypocrisy. Had the zealots (of all religions) got their way then there would not be very many coffee houses open today.</p>

                <img src="assets/devils_cup.jpg" alt="White cup of black coffee with flames"  class="w-100 my-3"/>

                <p> Initially, coffee was met with suspicion and religious prejudice in the Middle East and Turkey. Rumor has it, it was a mysterious, exotic and intoxicating liquor. To Catholics it was the ‘bitter invention of Satan’, carrying the whiff of Islam, and it seemed suspiciously like a substitute for wine as used in the Eucharist; in any event, it was outlawed.</p>

                <img src="assets/revolution.jpg" alt="Age of Revolution" class="w-100 my-3"/>

                <p>Coffee was significantly drunk in the ubiquitous public coffee houses which sprang up in villages, towns and cities across the Middle East and east Africa. Coffee drinking and conversation were complemented by all manner of entertainment: musical performances, dancing, games of chess and, most crucially, gossiping, arguing and discussing the breaking news of the day (or night). These coffee houses soon became known as ‘schools of the wise’, the place you went to if you wanted to know what was going on in your world.</p>

                <img src="assets/sexy_coffee.jpg" alt="Hot cup of coffee with evaporation smoke in a shape of a woman." class="w-100 my-3"/>

                <p>In the 1674 <i>The Women’s Petition Against Coffee</i>, wives argued that coffee “made men as unfruitful as the deserts whence that unhappy berry is said to be brought, so much so that the offspring of our mighty ancestors would dwindle into a succession of apes and pigmies”. <i>Men's Answer</i> to <i>The Women’s Petition Against Coffee</i> protested that it was “base adulterate wine” and “muddy ale” that made men impotent. Coffee, on the other hand, was the Viagra of the day, making “the erection more vigorous, the ejaculation more full, add[ing] a spiritualascendency to the sperm.”</p>
